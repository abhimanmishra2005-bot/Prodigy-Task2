# Task 2: Stopwatch Web Application

This project is a fully functional stopwatch web application built using fundamental web technologies. The primary goal was to create an interactive and user-friendly tool to measure time intervals with precision, including the ability to record and display lap times.

## Features

- **Start/Stop Functionality**: Easily start and stop the stopwatch with a single button that toggles its state.
- **Pause/Resume**: The same button allows users to pause the timer and resume it from the exact moment it was stopped.
- **Reset**: A dedicated reset button clears the timer and all recorded laps, returning the stopwatch to its initial state (00:00:00).
- **Lap Timer**: Users can record an unlimited number of lap times. Each lap is captured and displayed in a clean, scrollable list.
- **Accurate Time Display**: The timer displays hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds for precise time tracking.
- **Clean & Responsive UI**: The interface is designed to be intuitive and works well on various screen sizes.

## Demo

To see the stopwatch in action, open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Provides the basic structure of the application, including the display area, control buttons, and the list for lap times.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling the application to create a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface. This includes button styles, layout, and typography.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Powers all the core logic of the stopwatch. This includes:
    - Handling time calculations and updates.
    - Managing the start, pause, and reset states.
    - Implementing the lap recording functionality.
    - Dynamically updating the DOM to display the time and lap records.

## Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Download the files**: You will need all three project files:
    - `index.html`
    - `style.css`
    - `script.js`

2.  **Place files together**: Ensure all three files are in the same folder.

    ```
    /stopwatch-project
    ├── index.html
    ├── style.css
    └── script.js
    ```

3.  **Open in Browser**: Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.

No external libraries or build tools are needed to run this application.

## File Structure

- **`index.html`**: This file sets up the main content and layout of the stopwatch, including the timer display, the control buttons (Start/Pause, Reset, Lap), and the area where lap times will be listed.
- **`style.css`**: This file contains all the styling rules to make the application look good. It defines the colors, fonts, spacing, and responsive behavior of the UI elements.
- **`script.js`**: This is the heart of the application. It contains all the JavaScript code to make the stopwatch work, including functions to manage the timer, handle button clicks, and update the display.
