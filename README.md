A fully functional, single-file stopwatch web application built with fundamental web technologies. The primary goal was to create an interactive, user-friendly, and visually appealing tool to measure time intervals with precision, including the ability to record and display detailed lap times.

This project was created as part of the web development tasks from **Prodigy InfoTech**.
